# Final project [109065711]

Using the method provided by DAG-Map: Graph Based FPGA Technology Mapping For Delay Optimization.

Using C++11.

## Compile

```bash
./make.sh
```



## Usage

```bash
./map -k 2 input.blif
```

I only implement DMIG algorithm of the paper, so the argument k have to be 2.

## Data Structure

I use map from STL to store the graph of circuits.

### First Version (Not using the method of DMIG)

在 [直接拆的版本] 資料節內。

```bash
